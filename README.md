<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Diliara</h1>
<h3 align="center">Studying frontend development and having fun with it</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently practising **in responsive web design, CSS Grid and flexbox and I'm gonna do my best in using BEM**

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/divperedi](https://github.com/divperedi)

- ⚡ Fun fact: **The Night's Watch cloaks in Game of Thrones were made from Ikea rugs. The show bought the rugs, shaved them down and then dyed them to make the cloaks. And on that note hello from Sweden!**
